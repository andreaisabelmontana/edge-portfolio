# THEEDGE

## What the site is made of

- **Webflow** — the pages (`index.html`, `calendar/`, `on-track/`, `off-track/`,
  `online/`) are Webflow-generated. One shared stylesheet + `webflow.*.js`
  (both under `assets/cdn.prod.website-files.com/`).
- **Bundle** 
  custom orchestration bundle (GSAP + Lenis + Three.js + Rive),. It drives the page transitions, the
  scroll choreography, all Rive canvases, and the WebGL scenes.
- **Rive animations** (`rive/*.riv`) — page transition, animated buttons,
  signature, circuits, phrases marquee, etc. Played via the Rive runtime
  embedded in the agency bundle (wasm in `vendor/@rive-app/canvas-lite@2.26.4/`).
- **WebGL scene** (`gl/`) — Three.js assets: Draco-compressed GLB models
  (helmet, head "disco" ball, track ribbons), PBR texture sets in two variants
  (`webp` for desktop >991px, `ktx2` for mobile), HDRI environment maps for
  lighting, and MSDF font atlases for 3D text. Decoders in `gl/draco/` and
  `gl/basis/`.


## Good places to start reading

- `index.html` — search for `data-wf-page` and `w-embed` to see how Webflow
  structures a page, and `data-rive-` / `data-gl` for the animation hooks the
  agency bundle consumes.
- Watch the Network tab while scrolling: Rive files and GL textures load lazily.
